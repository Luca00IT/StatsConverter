# StatsLover

Using "Python-tesseract," an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool, StatsLover converts images and/or screenshots of one's computer into statistics.

## Manual MODE (50% completed)
Manual mode is to load a jpg or png file into the software and extract from it a .txt file containing the text or create a real .xls file by easily importing your own templates to speed up the creation of statistics from images.

## Auto MODE (0% completed)
Auto mode consists of a series of automatic steps such as:

- Select a database category (video games, basic software, etc...)
- Select an already compiled database
- Select a key to press to take screenshots
- Select additional or full mode, which adds data to each screenshot to a single excel or creates a full excel to each screenshot

And that's it. With the automatic mode, it will be possible to create entire excel pages with a single key.
