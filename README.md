## MANUAL (50% development completed)
Manual mode consists of the following steps:

- Upload a .jpg/.png image from your computer
- Select the structure of your .xls file
- Create or import a database of strings

And that's it. With these few steps you can then download the .txt file or the .xls file as needed both containing the extracted text from the images.

## AUTO (0% development completed)
Auto mode consists of a series of automatic steps such as:

- Select a database category (video games, basic software, etc...)
- Select an already compiled database
- Select a key to press to take screenshots
- Select additional or full mode, which adds data to each screenshot to a single excel or creates a full excel to each screenshot

And that's it. With the automatic mode, it will be possible to create entire stats with a single key.
